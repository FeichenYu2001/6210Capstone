Data Science Resume Checklist
A resume is essential for landing any job, but creating a great data science
resume can be tricky. What sections should you include? How do you best
showcase your skills? What are the most important things to highlight?
This Data Science Resume checklist offers a simple and concrete way to examine
your resume. With this list, you can check and fix your resume following a
step-by-step guide and practical steps.
General Guidelines
Below we are going to get into some specifics for making your Data Science
resume stand out, but before that, let’s discuss the basics.
The goal of a Data Science resume is to get you a job in Data Science. The entire
resume needs to be centered on that goal.
This means that your priority should be highlighting Data Science related skills
and experience. Anything not relevant to that will not help you reach your goal.
Furthermore, too much information will only distract your reader.
So, the basics to writing a great Data Science resume are relatively simple:keep it
concise and keep it relevant to Data Science.
Let’s take a look at some practical tips to achieve that!

Sections and Order
What sections should you include on your Data Science resume? And does it
matter what order they appear in on the resume? The sections should adhere to
our basic resume goal of being concise and relevant.
You can achieve that by putting the most relevant information first and
streamlining your sections to only include what someone hiring for a data science
position would be most interested in.
Sections to Include:
Contact Information
Professional Experience
Technical Capability
Education
Projects (Optional)
Certificates (Optional)
Here is a template to show you the basic outline:

Some things to make particular note of for your sections include:
●Professional Experience should always go at the top, under Contact
Information, as this is the section recruiters care most about.
●Include the projects and certificate sections only if they are relevant, and
your resume needs filling out.
●Too much content is bad for a resume as it often distracts from the
information relevant to the job to which you are applying.
Sections to Avoid:
Remember that the overall goal of the resume is to get a job in Data Science. You
thus want to avoid anything that is not directly relevant to a Data Science
position. Below are some sections you should leave off your resume.
Hobbies
Volunteer Experience
Interests
Not only are these sections not related to Data Science, but they also make your
resume rather lengthy. Keep your resume concise so that important information
is easy to find.
Resume Dos
Now that you have your sections organized, there are some specific things to
keep in mind when crafting your resume.
General Tips:
Keep it to one page. Always.
Less than 15% of recruiters spend more than one minute looking at a
resume. They are not going to look at a second page.
Customize your resume for each position.
Include key traits and skills that each job description mentioned.

For the Professional Experience and Projects sections:
Prioritize.
List your experience and projects in order of importance rather than
chronologically. The first bullet point in each section should be the most
impactful.
Be concise.
Keep both sections to four bullet points or less. Also, limit each bullet point
to 2 lines (physical lines not sentences) so that everything is easy to read
and concise.
Be specific.
Show exactly what you have accomplished with numbers and metrics,
explain what type of data you were processing, and tell what programming
language or software you used. This shows that your expertise is genuine.
For example, instead of just putting “improved system efficiency” write
“improved system efficiency by 10%”. Metrics make your achievements and
impact clear and tangible.
Use strong verbs.
For a Data Science resume, strong verbs are those that highlight your role
and the results. For instance, use verbs like “led, drove, optimized, and
improved” rather than verbs like “processed, built, and developed”.
Be outcome-oriented.
When making a point, start with the result and then explain what you did
to achieve that. So something like “Wrangled 50GB of data to produce a 5%
increase in data quality” should become “Improved data quality by 5% by
wrangling 50GB of data”. The emphasis should be on your achievements
and results rather than the job details.
For Technical Capability:
Organize.
All the relevant skills you have can become quite a list. To make things easy
to digest, place them in categories.
Customize.
The exact technical capabilities will vary from job to job. Make adjustments
to this section both in what you include and what you put first to best suit
each job description.

Here is an example of what a Technical Capabilities section might look like:
Resume Don’ts
Now that you know what to do on your resume, you also need to know what not
to do. Use the following tips to polish your resume and keep it as professional as
possible.
Avoid typos.
Typos make your resume look unprofessional. Proofread and have a friend
proofread it just to make sure.
Minimize abbreviations.
Do not risk the recruiter not knowing what you mean. For example, you
should spell out the phrase Machine Learning rather than putting ML to
ensure that recruiters understand.
Remove redundant phrases and points.
Aim to be as concise as possible in your word choice. Some common wordy
phrases include things like “in order to”, which can be replaced with “to”
and “is able to”, which can be replaced with “can”.
Don’t get too technical.
Only include the information relevant to the job to which you are applying.
Too much technical jargon makes your resume difficult to understand and
unnecessarily wordy. For example, reduce “used ADAM optimizer with
parse_categorical_cross_entropy" to simply "used ADAM optimizer".
Don’t use oral language.
A resume is a written document. Avoid saying things like “I did this” and
“we accomplished”.
